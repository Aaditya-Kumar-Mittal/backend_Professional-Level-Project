- Folders are not pushed to Github so we make .gitkeep files to push and keep track of empty folders
- Create a .env file to store the environment variables. You can use online gitignore generators for that.
- More organized codes in src folder
- Dev dependencies are not pushed to Github and are used only for development during production
- All the dependencies are listed in package.json
